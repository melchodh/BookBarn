            <h3>Tomboyland: Essays <br> By Melissa Faliveno</h3>
            <p>A fiercely personal and startlingly universal essay collection 
                about the mysteries of gender and desire, of identity and class, 
                of the stories we tell and the places we call home.</p>

            <h3>Still True <br>By Maggie Ginsberg</h3>
            <p>One summer evening, Lib Hanson is confronted by her painful 
                past when Matt Marlow, the forty-year-old son she abandoned as 
                an infant, shows up on her porch. Fiercely independent, Lib has 
                never revealed her son’s existence—or her previous marriage—to 
                her husband, Jack. Married nearly three decades but living in separate houses (to the confusion but acceptance of their neighbors), 
                they enjoy an ease and comfort together in small-town Anthem, 
                Wisconsin. But Jack is a stickler for honesty, and Lib’s long-dormant secret threatens to unravel their lives.</p>

            <h3>Morgan's Pick!</h3>
            <p>“An iconic memoir about the 
                struggles of assimilation and what 
                it can do to a family. When it was 
                released, there was an outcry 
                about whether to categorize it as 
                fiction or nonfiction. A story that 
                still applies to us today."</p>

            <p>“A timely novel that transports 
                you back to 1800s Russia, with 
                themes that still are chillingly 
                real.”</p>
