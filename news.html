            When driving around Eau Claire, the attentive observer may notice
the aging architectural remnants of a once-emerging industrial
city: an abandoned sanatorium, a funeral home along the Chippe-
wa River, a historic “cottage style” gas station. Over the years, a
few such structures have been updated to fit with the rest of the
modern-day scenery, though much of the history of these buildings
(and those no longer standing) is preserved by way of photographs
archived at the Chippewa Valley Museum.<br><br>
Jodi Kiffmeyer and Diana Peterson work at the Chippewa Valley
Museum as the archivist and editor/assistant curator, respectively.
Together, they collaborated to research and write a book using a
small fraction of the 27,000 photos in the museum’s collection.
Reflections of Eau Claire: A Photo History of the City, 1870-1998, is
the product of extensive research that combines historical photo-
graphs with short descriptions of related events and people.
“Jodi and I work really well together because we like very different
eras,” Peterson says. “So, Jodi’s really into the 1880s through the
1920s, and I’m more into the 1930s through the 1960s.” Their
passion can be seen on every page of the book, from Eau Claire’s
beginnings as a lumber town to the development of industry and
downtown entertainment. Iconic landmarks like The Joynt and the
Hollywood Theatre are included in its pages, along with surprising
historical facts. “If you’ve only been here the last ten years, you
have absolutely no idea of the history of [The Joynt] regarding
guests and the unbelievable jazz musicians that came to Eau Claire
and performed here,” Peterson says.<br><br>
In addition to the included photographs, Kiffmeyer and Peterson
found other sources to help tell the stories of iconic buildings. One
of the more interesting sources is Ralph Owen, an Eau Claire resi-
dent in the first half of the 1900s. “Ralph Owen was a guy who
grew up in Eau Claire, and he had copious notes of what went on
in Eau Claire, [including] a couple thousand pages of a manuscript
that were donated to the archives,” Kiffmeyer says. “That’s where I
get a lot of information.” Even the city directories lack a lot of the
information that residents like Owen have otherwise documented.
Many of these buildings included in the book can no longer be
found standing in Eau Claire. However, their stories are preserved
in other ways, often through the work of volunteers or people pas-
sionate about preservation. “[In] a lot of ways this book is the
story of success, and what you might call failure of people trying to
preserve the history of Eau Claire,” Kiffmeyer says. The Soo Depot,
destroyed in 1997, was an important stop for train routes through
Eau Claire but no longer had a use as demand for public transpor-
tation waned. Its legacy is now preserved through photos and
records kept by the history museum even though the building is no
longer standing. The Depot occupied the S Dewey and Eau Claire
streets, near the L.E. Phillips Public Library.<br><br>
Despite having so many sources of information to draw from, much
of the information had to be left out to present the photos effec-
tively. “For a lot of these [photos] I could have written three or
four times as much as I did,” Kiffmeyer says. “This is just scratch-
ing the surface of some of these stories.” Kiffmeyer and Peterson
view this as a great opportunity for those interested in local history
to support the Chippewa Valley Museum since a membership
allows access to the entirety of its archive for Eau Claire and fur-
ther information on each picture in the book.<br><br>
