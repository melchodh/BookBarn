        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            BookBarn has been open since 2017, when
            Joseph felt the need for a more inclusive and
            sustainable bookstore in his hometown of Eau
            Claire, WI. He managed to find an old barn on
            the outskirts of town and rebuilt it all, by hand,
            to house what is now BookBarn.
            </p>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>
            BookBarn is located in scenic Eau Claire, and is
            surrounded by farm fields as far as the eye can
            see. We offer a laid-back shopping experience
            and chill vibes.
            </p>
            <h3>Commitment to Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
            BookBarn is committed to sustainability. We are
            working on eliminating plastic from our store, which
            means single-use shopping bags, coffee cups, and
            wrapping are not provided. Customers are
            encouraged to bring their own bags, coffee mugs,
            and gift wrap in order to make sure our impact on
            the earth in minimal or non-existent.</p>

            <p>Abigail's story is one woven with pages and bound by a profound love 
                for literature. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills, she

                solace in the pages of her favorite stories, sparking a lifelong passion for

                After completing her education with a degree in English Literature, 
                Abigail sought a way to intertwine her love for books with her career. 
                She found herself drawn to the welcoming ambiance of a local

            <h3>Joseph</h3>
            <p>
                From an early age, Joseph's fascination with the world of 
books was evident. Growing up in a family that revered 
literature, Joseph's childhood was filled with enchanting 
tales and visits to local bookstores that sparked an 
unquenchable love for the written word.
After years of nurturing this deep-seated passion, Joseph
